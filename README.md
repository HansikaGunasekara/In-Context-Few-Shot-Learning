**This is to study how prompting will Revolutionise Automation Workflows in Finance**

I use **GPT-3.5-turbo-0125** model to experiment the prompting based approach on CONVFINQA. Analyzed over 6 different instances in the **train.json** with different number of examples for zero shot learning presents the following model reasoning & answering.

In section 6.3, the paper summarizes the follwoing findings:

**1. GPT-3 can do simple calculations by itself**

**2. GPT-3 performs better for its familiar program**

**3. GPT-3 struggles with new complex tasks & paradigms**

Above table presents similar findings with **GPT-3.5-turbo-0125** model.
